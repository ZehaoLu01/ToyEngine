# ToyEngine
## Introduction
This is a personal game engine project. Will start with a basic renderer, and then introduce more sub systems. My ultimate goal is to make a Grand Strategy Game engine, making it easier and faster to create strategy games.
## Implemented Features
- RenderSystem that renders obj files to the screen. Some basic shaders are implemented.
- ImGUI editor with docking feature
- File explorer
## TODO
- Add advanced shading.
- Improve existing ImGUI editor.
