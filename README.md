# ToyEngine
## Introduction
This is a personal game engine project. Will start with a basic renderer, and then introduce more sub systems. My ultimate goal is to make a Grand Strategy Game engine, making it easier and faster to create strategy games.
## Implemented Features
- A Snake game derived from prior project
## TODO
- Add gameobjects to the renderer(light source, basic objects like cubes and spheres and imported models)
  - Implement light sources including spot light and directional light
  - Import Assimp lib to support external models
- Try to use ImGUI to create a simple editor that can add objects to the scene
- Add Shaders, including Phong model, Blinn-Phong model and PBR.
